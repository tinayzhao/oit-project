Foodbook is a TypeScript-React application that presents the user with existing Spoonacular recipes based on their preferences and the current ingredients in their pantry.

Libraries: [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs), [React AAD Msal](https://github.com/syncweek-react-aad/react-aad), [React Router Dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom), [React Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap), [React Multi Carousel](https://github.com/YIZHUANG/react-multi-carousel)


## Weekly progress
### Week 1
Met my mentor and we brainstormed ideas for an application.
	
### Week 2
Created a React Typescript application to test out different APIs to see if my ideas were feasible: Spoonacular API, its RapidAPI equivalent, Eventbrite API, and the Ticketmaster API. 

### Week 3
Decided to go with the recipe app and we deemed that the priority was to get a barebones web application with working functionality. 

### Week 4
Refreshed on React and started learning TypeScript. Designated and created essential components: SignIn, SignUp, Preferences, Pantry, Dashboard page. Implemented routing to pages. 

### Week 5
Started implementing authentication using Microsoft Azure AAD. 

### Week 6
Barebone features for Preferences and Pantry page finished. Due to authentication, SignIn/SignUp pages were scrapped for a Welcome page. Restructured code to pass on information between different pages. 

### Week 7
Styling for Welcome page. Incorporated Spoonacular API.

### Week 8
More styling for Preferences, Pantry, and Dashboard page. 

### Week 9
Graduation week - presented project to mentor. Reflection on project. Working on deploying project to website. 

## Credits
My project as a mentee for [Out in Tech U's Mentorship Program](https://outintech.com/mentorship/). I highly recommend it and want to give kudos to my mentor Sarah D'Onofrio for supporting me throughout these 8 weeks! I credit the idea and inspiration for this application to the awesome teammates I met at IvyHacks: Lucas Gelfond, Ethan Asis, and Nomit Paulja.
